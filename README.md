## React PGN Chess

This is a chess board implemented with React that emits PGN signals on every move made by players. It is specially designed to be integrated with [PGN Chess](https://github.com/programarivm/pgn-chess), which is a PHP chess board representation that runs on the server side.

> Side Note: React PGN Chess is currently on development. Please be patient. Contributions are welcome!
